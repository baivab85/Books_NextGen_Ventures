I've created a simple HTML structure for the book details with placeholders for the book cover, author, genre, and number of pages.

CSS is used to style the layout and buttons.

JavaScript is used to handle the functionality of displaying different books and updating the details when the "Next" and "Previous" buttons are clicked.

The book details are stored in an array of objects called books.

The displayBook() function updates the book details displayed on the page.

The nextBook() and previousBook() functions handle the logic for moving to the next and previous books in the array.
